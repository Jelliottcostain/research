:Part A:

Part A is a requsition program prototype using functions. It has very minimal function. 
It can take a users basic information, take a total and then produce a 'receipt' as well as an approval or not from management.

This file mainly makes use of functions to operate. Since this was just a proof of concept there is no data storage unlike what Part B was supposed to achieve. 
This file just makes use of the above mentioned functions to layout how the final program should work.

:Part B:

Part B is incomplete and has very poor implementation of instances within classes. 
It aims to build upon Part A by storing the staff members information and allowing management to directly intervene requests with declines, pendings and approvals.

This file expands on the previous file by using a class with methods (the methods being the functions from the previous 'Part A'). These methods are suppose to make creating instances easier, making sets of information using the same rules.
This however was not implemented correctly yet.

The point of this file and project was to show how classes and instances can be used to store multiple chunks of information/objects. 

:Practice Folder:

This folder shows some of the basics of python that I practiced through different scenarios. Not all of the files will have comments.
Notably there isn't anything relating to more advanced python functions such as classes and instances. Mainly due to me having very limited time with them.
There is no real order to any of the files.
