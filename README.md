:Part A:
Part A is a requsition program prototype using functions. It has very minimal function. 
It can take a users basic information, take a total and then produce a 'receipt' as well as an approval or not from management.

:Part B:
Part B is incomplete and has very poor implementation of instances within classes. 
It aims to build upon Part A by storing the staff members information and allowing management to directly intervene requests with declines, pendings and approvals.
